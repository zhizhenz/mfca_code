The folder random_rewiring_model contains the numerical experiments with the probabilistic models in Section 6. The main job scripts are 
1. jobscript_small_n.m ---generate results for figures 2-3 in the paper
2. jobscript_example_1.m ---generate results for figures 4--8 in the paper
3. jobscript_example_2.m ---generate results for figure 10. 

The folder cryoEM_code includes the numerical results with the simulated cryo-EM projection images. The main job script is 
1. jobscript_cryo_EM.m
